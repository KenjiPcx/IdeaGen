In terms of tipping vs membership ratio, my guess is initially people will mostly tip, and as I grow, my monthly subscribers will increase in order to access the discord.

    "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI used to run multiple 150k Instagram pages around 4 years ago. One way I made alot of money was through an affiliate style app called the Plugco.\n\nI have recently got back into Instagram and scaled a page within a few months to 400k.\n\nWe are yet to run ads, and unfortunately the landscape of Instagram has changed where we are only getting targeted and asked to run OF ads which we wont do. \n\nI recently thought back to using the Plug app however it seems this app is now only available for TikTok. \n\nDoes anyone have experience in using other affiliate style apps or having any ideas on what affiliate programs work the best.\n\nAgain we only want to push products we know our audience wants, not stuff like OF ads.\n\nJust to mention, as we scaled the page quickly our auidence is highly engaged and is majority based in USA, UK and Australia. Plus we have never ran ads before on this page.\n\nAny help would be really appreciated. Thank you!",

However, I have noticed that the sales don't seem to allocate properly for a few days in some cases & as a result it has really dialled back the ad spend. EG Wednesday had 4 sales allocated to it as of now whilst on Thursday morning it only had 1. It's the same for pretty much every day & even though it is hitting the cost per sale target it is dialling back the ad spend. I only set the ads to Cost Per Sale last Monday & I do know that this is no where near enough time for it to learn and adapt etc. However will google continue to cut the ad spend unless I get the sales to upload quicker? If so, how do I do this? Or is this something time will heal.\n\nAlso, I'm not 100%  convinced it's accounting for every sale that comes through the ads as Shopify's tracking doesn't always tally up with Googles tracking. Is there anything I can do about this? Or am I generally out of luck with this one?",

For example:\n\n* **3 seconds hook with the artist looking at the camera with texts like Matching tattoo ideas for couples, Best anime tattoos to get etc. then a highlight of artist works that relate to those topics**\n\n+ a call to action to DM for a quote\n\nThey are present on Facebook, Instagram and Tiktok as well, so for one post per day on all these platforms it would be 90/month. - 90 chances to go viral and get leads for FREE\n\nThis is basically what I do with my travel themed Instagram pages (I have around 200k followers across my accounts). On those, I use ManyChat to capture leads by giving away free guides. It works well \u2013 I get around 40 leads per day from that method.\n\n**But here\u2019s the catch:**  \nI know the travel niche and tattoo shops are totally different markets, and I\u2019m not sure if the same strategy will work for tattoos..\n\nDid you guys try to do something similar organic lead gen for a local b2c business? How did it go?",

But you can imagine or compare to any similar service. The case here is, benefits provided are different than the core business offering.\n\nWhen AAA gives benefits such as discounts & deals to its members, how does this whole business process work -\n\n1. Does AAA go to the manufacturers/restaurants/brands (referred to as Companies in further questions below) and ask them to provide products to its members at a discounted price ? Or companies reach out to AAA and say, ' here is discounted product for your members' ?\n2. Does AAA get any cut from this ? or its reverse - AAA has to pay the Companies when any of the member actually makes the purchase as a member of AAA ?\n3. If AAA reaches out to Companies, does it do by reaching out to them one by one or is there any marketplace like affiliate marketplaces ? How does it source those deals ?\n4. Lets say out of 100,000 paid members of AAA, 100 avail the discounted deal from a specific Company. How do they (AAA & the Company) track it ? How do they come to the same page when reconciling data at the end of a week or a month ? Do they use any technology for that ?\n\nIf there is any source to read more about it, please let me know.\n\nTIA for any pointers, guidance on this.  \n",

How do you use them?\n\nHow do you think this will change in the future?\n\nIs it a practical idea to sell the process of putting together a good and informative marketing ebook to b2b companies?\n\nI'm currently exploring the idea of choosing highly refined ebooks as my niche of content marketing because this really aligns well with what I am good at. I have a fair bit of experience with longer content formats and also layouts to make them visually appealing. I figured that I needed a niche that's more specific than just \"I do content marketing and a bit of SEO and see how that goes\", and in theory a good ebook can be a nice linkable asset but also serve as a blueprint for other, shorter content like a series of blog posts or short videos and so on. Curious what professional marketers have to say about that.\n",

I have talked to friends around me and even though they said they like my idea but they did not use them for real use. I wonder how I can reach out to more users. Here are the options:\n\n1. Hiring a generalist marketing person\n\n2. Hiring a few of interns/new grads for testing different channels\n\n3. Hiring agencies\n\n4. Doing all the work my self \n\nI wonder if anyone can share from their own experiences about the pros and cons for each option? I very much appreciate the help",

This would be like a learning process channel, watch my mistakes and how I fix them.\n\nIf you would be interested in this at all, what would you like to see out of it? My ideas so far would be a combined instagram and YouTube channel. Instagram to show the process in short clips with a voice over and YouTube to be more organic and in depth.\n\nSome things I would start with is quilted hot pads, simple table runners, place mats, pillows. Small projects what can be done in about a day so people with limited time can craft along if they wanted. Any patterns used that are not of my own creation would be credited to the creator and permission obtained to use with links provided to their pattern.\n\nI have noticed that there are young males that are starting to quilt, or at least in my local quilt shop, and I think it would be nice for them to see an older male doing so as well.\n\nI welcome any feedback or thoughts.",

    "content": "The brand I'm talking about is Tiege Hanley.\n\n  \n1\u2014 When the founders first started the brand, it wasn't going so well. They knew they had to get an unfair advantage over the competitors.  \n\n\nThey reached out to a trusted name in men's skincare and grooming -- Aaron M. (\\~6M+ followers on YT) and onboarded this mega influencer as their third partner.  \n\n\nThat was the turning point for the brand. But I was curious to find out why Aaron agreed & apparently, it was because of the founders' sincere pitch. It went something like this -- \u201cHey, we\u2019ve got a brand, and we\u2019re trying to educate guys on how to take care of their skin and make it easy for them.\u201d  \n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 The takeaway is that true influencers are passionate about what they endorse. Show how you can create genuine value for their audience.  \n\n\nAnd the most important step here is to find the influencers that check these boxes for you \u2014  \n\\- align with your target audience  \n\\- have the same values as your brand  \n\\- content style resonates with your audience & brand  \n\n\nI use apps like SARAL to find ideal influencers for brands that I help. You can even use hashtags research or just search on social media platforms.  \n\n\n2 \u2014 I watched 15-20 videos on TikTok where creators were showing Tiege Hanley's products and observed an interesting pattern: In every single one, they show the product box when introducing the brand, followed by individual items.  \n\n\nBut each creator has their own angle \u2014 skincare routine, how to look more attractive, bathroom essentials, etc.  \n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 The takeaway here is that when you're collaborating with influencers, don't box them in with a rigid script. Give them the value proposition, or guidelines but let them create the content they want.  \n*Let me know in the comments if you want to see the full research on Tiege Hanley. There are 3 more takeaways. I'll share them.*\n\nIf you know of any brands nailing their influencer game, drop their names below. I'd love to explore and share more insights about them.",

    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve worked with a number of service-based businesses, and I thought I\u2019d share some advice that\u2019s been effective for growing visibility and attracting clients, particularly for niche industries like water leak detection or other specialized services.\n\n1. Educate First, Sell Later: Create content that helps solve common problems your target audience faces. Blog posts, videos, or infographics showing how to spot early signs of a leak, for example, can build trust. People are more likely to book your services if they feel you\u2019re offering value before they even need you.\n\n\n2. Leverage Local SEO: Service businesses rely heavily on local customers, so optimizing for local search is key. Make sure your Google My Business profile is complete, and get those reviews coming in! This helps you appear in local search results when potential customers are looking for services nearby.\n\n\n3. Paid Ads with a Twist: If you\u2019re running ads, try using geo-targeted Facebook or Google Ads with a strong call-to-action. For example, offer a free inspection or special discount for first-time customers in a specific area. Targeting ads to smaller, specific regions can stretch your ad budget further.\n\n\n4. Partner with Related Businesses: Networking with businesses that have the same target audience but aren\u2019t direct competitors can lead to great referral partnerships. For example, plumbers or general contractors might be a good fit for water leak detection services.",

    "title": "Your Guide to Success in Quantitative Research: 8 Practical Tips",
    "content": "Quantitative research plays a crucial role in fields like social sciences, business, healthcare, and education. It provides numerical data that can be analyzed statistically to identify patterns, relationships, and trends. However, excelling in quantitative research requires more than just crunching numbers. \n\n# 1. Start with a Clear Research Question\n\nThe foundation of any successful research is a well-defined research question. This question guides the entire study, determining your methodology, data collection, and analysis. Ensure that your research question is specific, measurable, and aligned with the purpose of your study.\n\nFor example, instead of asking, \"How do students perform in school?\" a clearer question might be, \"What is the relationship between study hours and academic performance in high school students?\"\n\n**Tip**: Before starting, spend time refining your question. This will save you time and effort during the research process.\n\n# 2. Choose the Right Research Design\n\nQuantitative research can take many forms, including experiments, surveys, and observational studies. Choosing the right design depends on your research objectives and the type of data you need. Are you testing a hypothesis? \n\n**Tip**: Match your research design with your objectives to ensure you\u2019re collecting the right kind of data.\n\n# 3. Use Valid and Reliable Instruments\n\nThe tools you use to gather data\u2014whether they\u2019re questionnaires, tests, or measuring devices\u2014must be both **valid** (measuring what you intend to measure) and **reliable** (producing consistent results over time).\n\n**Tip**: If you\u2019re developing your own instrument, pilot it first with a small group to check its validity and reliability. If using an existing tool, review past studies to confirm it works well for your research population.\n\n# 4. Select an Appropriate Sample Size\n\nA common mistake in quantitative research is working with a sample size that\u2019s too small, which can lead to unreliable or inconclusive results. On the other hand, excessively large samples can waste resources. To avoid these pitfalls, conduct a **power analysis** to determine the optimal sample size for your study.\n\n**Tip**: Use tools like G\\*Power to calculate the right sample size based on your research goals and the expected effect size. This ensures your findings are statistically significant and applicable to a larger population.\n\n# 5. Ensure Random Sampling for Representativeness\n\nYour findings will only be meaningful if your sample represents the broader population you\u2019re studying. **Random sampling** ensures that every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected, reducing bias and increasing the generalizability of your results.\n\n**Tip**: Use random sampling methods (e.g., simple random sampling, stratified random sampling) to ensure your data is as representative as possible.\n\n# 6. Minimize Bias in Data Collection\n\nBias can creep into any research process, affecting the accuracy and fairness of your results. To reduce bias, carefully design your data collection process. For example, avoid leading questions in surveys and standardize how data is collected across all participants to prevent interviewer or observer bias.\n\n**Tip**: Blind or double-blind studies can help minimize bias, especially in experiments where participants or researchers might be influenced by expectations.\n\n# 7. Analyze Data Properly with the Right Statistical Tools\n\nOnce you\u2019ve collected your data, the next step is analysis. Choosing the right statistical tests is essential to interpret your findings correctly. Descriptive statistics (like means and frequencies) give a broad overview, while inferential statistics (like t-tests, chi-squares, or regression analyses) help determine whether your findings are statistically significant.\n\n**Tip**: If you\u2019re unsure which test to use, consult a statistician or use resources like statistical decision trees to guide your choice based on your data type and research questions.\n\n# 8. Interpret Results with Context and Caution\n\nAfter analyzing your data, it\u2019s tempting to jump to conclusions. However, quantitative research is not just about the numbers; it\u2019s about what those numbers mean in context. Always interpret your results in relation to your research question and the existing body of knowledge.\n\nBe cautious when generalizing your findings, especially if your sample size is small or non-representative.

I have never sent a single email or set up an email campaign for anything except the automated \"abandoned cart\" or \"review request\" sent by Shopify or my review app. The reason I haven't done it is because I personally hate spam, but I heard it works for a lot of brands.\n\nAs a small store with no large revenue, I am looking for some email marketing tips. I've installed Klaviyo, Omnisend, Mailchimp and Yotpo.  I really wanted to be Klaviyo, but their pricing model scares me. I cannot justify paying $250 a month, especially if I would probably not send it to everyone on the list. Omnisend is cheaper but with the same pricing structure. (On one hand, they have tools to grow your list, on the other hand they will slap you with higher fees for having it). That leaves me with Yotpo which I am currently trying. It looks like it is full of features the other ESPs have, and the price seems right since I am not a heavy marketer. Is Yopto new? Because I couldn't find too many people using it and I find it kinda buggy. I'm asking because it seems like a lot of work setting up the segmentations and flows, etc. and once they have those hooks in you it's hard to switch. Any suggestions?",

    "content": "Hey all,\n\nI\u2019m building an online marketplace on WooCommerce (with MultiVendorX) to sell retail products in Australia and could use some expert advice. There are so many CRM and email marketing options out there, I\u2019m struggling to figure out the best fit. Should I go for an integrated solution or use separate tools for CRM and email? Budget isn\u2019t a deal-breaker, but I\u2019d prefer something that doesn\u2019t get ridiculously expensive as my contact list grows.\n\n**What\u2019s important to me:**\n\n* Tracking acquisition performance across channels.\n* Easy setup and testing for newsletters.\n* Social integrations to track performance across channels.\n* Multiple workflows.\n* A single customer database that I can enrich over time.\n* Out-of-the-box WooCommerce integration.\n\n**What I\u2019ve looked at:**\n\n* Zoho suite: Seems good, but I\u2019m not sure which modules I need.\n* HighLevel: A friend recommended it, but I don\u2019t know much about them.\n* HubSpot: Loved it in a past B2B business, but it got pricey for digital marketing.\n\nWould love to hear what you\u2019d recommend and why! Appreciate any help.\n\nUpvote1Downvote0Go to comments  \n",

It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve worked on a Meta account (8 months or so\u2026 and quite a bit has changed) \n\nI\u2019m working with a new client (ecomm business) and trying to find the best approach to work with a limited $1000/month Meta budget. \n\nThey ran Meta ads with a previous agency and didn\u2019t get the results they wanted. CPAs were extremely, extremely high. \n\nI audited the account and definitely felt that the broad targeting fell short and wasn\u2019t going after the right customer. \n\nI believe I\u2019ve rectified this with my take on the Broad Audience targeting. Question regarding this: \n\n1. Given the limited budget, do I stick to my interest targeting or should I still cast the net wider (as per Metas reco) and go with Advantage Detailed Targeting instead? \n\n2. What roles to LAL still play? I have a healthy size at 5% based off the company\u2019s CRM list and past Purchaser list. \n\n3. Would you place a LAL and broad audience as separate ad sets in the same campaign? Or would it be best to run 2 separate campaigns to get a better understanding of individual performance. (Same campaign goals) \n\nAnything else I should be thinking about? Or any questions you need answered to better help me solve my problem? LMK! \n\nTIA.\nN\n",

    "content": "**Long-time lurker here! I wanted to share some insights and motivation from my Facebook ad campaigns.**\n\nLast 30 days:  \n[https://ibb.co/4WmCgsj](https://ibb.co/4WmCgsj)\n\n[https://ibb.co/f1HdGJV](https://ibb.co/f1HdGJV)\n\n**Background:**  \nI\u2019ve been managing my ad account for the past four years, primarily focusing on the board game niche in Scandinavia. My ad spend peaks around the holiday season, from late September to December, with a budget of 30-40k. I own a board game brand, so my campaigns drive both direct-to-consumer (D2C) and business-to-business (B2B) sales. While my products generally have higher price points on my site, many consumers search for better deals after seeing my ads and often end up at my B2B partners' sites. This increased visibility has driven bulk orders as demand for my games grows among retailers.\n\n**Ad Strategy:**  \nMy typical strategy involves a \"3-2-2\" setup, but I occasionally run single ads when I believe I have a strong concept based on past performance. Here\u2019s how I structure my campaigns:\n\n* **Formats:** I use three main types of creative:\n   1. User-generated content (UGC)-style informational videos, around 40 seconds long, filmed at home.\n   2. High-quality product images.\n   3. Multiple images and videos showcasing key features in a carousel or slideshow format.\n* **Initial Testing:** I start by spending $20-40 on a new ad within the first 24 hours. During this period, I monitor metrics like CPC, CTR, and thumb-stop rates (measuring how many people pause while scrolling).\n   * My benchmarks: a CPC under $0.50 and a CTR of at least 1.5% (2%+ is ideal), which often indicate good conversion potential.\n* **Optimization:** After three days, I evaluate the ROAS. If it\u2019s below 2.0, the ad likely won\u2019t perform well. A ROAS above 3.0 is strong, while ads with a ROAS between 2.0 and 3.0 are allowed to run for seven days.\n   * If results improve, I increase the budget by 10-20% daily.\n* **Targeting:** While I used to spend more time testing different audiences, I now rely on Facebook\u2019s Advantage+ automation, which has been effective. I still keep my target in mind, primarily women aged 30+ with children.\n\n**Seasonal Prep:**  \nI do most of my testing in September and October to identify winning ads before the peak sales period in mid-November. Since my products are niche and branded, this also drives awareness as we approach the busiest shopping weeks.\n\n**Landing Page Optimization:**  \nEffective ads require strong landing pages. I use Shopify and spend significant time optimizing product pages:\n\n* **Structure:** 4 high-quality product images, a concise product pitch, 2 informative graphics highlighting key features, and customer reviews.\n* I aim to have essential product information and the buy button above the fold, making it easy for users to purchase without scrolling.\n* My conversion rate typically ranges from 3.5% to 8% during peak periods, which I take pride in.\n\n**Shopify Apps:**  \nI keep my setup simple, using Vitals, Bundle Bee, 17track, and Klaviyo for email marketing.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like insights on anything specific",

    "content": "Sorry for the junior level of question here.\n\nPrimarily a PPC marketer here that dabbles in SEO. My business on Shopify has been subject to multiple bot traffic spikes this year. We sell DTC on Shopify, but also via Amazon Seller Central, and a few other marketplaces as well.\n\nOur website has been subject to many traffic spikes, which after further research all signs point to bots being the culprit. Most of the traffic spikes have no UTMs, high bounce rate/low engagement rate, and usually no location data. This affects my business reporting both in Shopify and GA4.\n\nWe have worked very hard on building up our organic rankings on some very competitive keywords. We're on the first page for several B2B keywords that get millions of monthly searches, so I want to be very careful to not block googlebot or similar verified tools.\n\nI've seen other sources suggest to adjust our robots.txt file [to disallow everything except for some verified bots](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57195339/how-to-block-all-bots-except-google-and-bing). But that seems to simple to be true? Maybe I'm pessimistic, but would blocking all bots except for the  [verified bots list from Cloudflare](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/verified-bots) actually work? Can I successfully block bots via the robots.txt file or will a 3rd party paid tool need to be considered?",

The only thing I noticed is the inventory, I have only 13 units and they have 270 units. What do you guys recommend me to do?  I have 2 things in mind: \n1- go down with the price and this will cut down the profit considerably.\n2- send 100 units to my FBA inventory to be eligible to the shipment optimization. Not sure if this is wise, I believe I would sell 25 units/month at best if the buy box rotates evenly. IDK\nI need advice on that or any other way to avoid losing money. What do you guys recommend?

    "title": "The Best BFCM Email Marketing Guide",
    "content": "**Black Friday/Cyber Monday Email Marketing Guide**\n\nEvery year I make a post on here for BFCM based on my experience managing Email/SMS marketing for hundreds of brands. I always try to add the new things I\u2019ve learned to improve the quality of the posts I made on Reddit last year.\n\nThis guide is targeted at store owners doing at least 25k+ per month, with an email list that has over 1500 people. If your store doesn\u2019t meet these requirements, you\u2019ll still learn a thing or 2 from this post & if you\u2019re doing 250k+ per month, I'm sure your marketing for the most important month of the year is probably already sorted. So, for all you entrepreneurs in the middle, don\u2019t fumble this. A well-executed Q4 can EASILY add 40% to your business's annual revenue.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**This is what you can do to improve your deliverability and conversion rate for BFCM:**\n\n1. **Segment Your List** - Treat your VIP customers and your non-buyers differently. VIPs get early access and special treatment\u2014they should feel appreciated for supporting your brand in the past & encouraged to do it again. Now is the time to make a PUSH to get people who bought last year ( Around this time ) onto your SMS list. I\u2019m going to say some real shit. SMS will never be as good as emails, but if there\u2019s 1 month where it makes sense to double down on SMS marketing it's November.\n2. **Write Good Subject Lines** - Your subject line needs to stop people in their tracks. I\u2019ve said this plenty of times, and I\u2019ll say it again. There are 2 ways to create a good subject line. Either you\u2019re extremely direct and say something like \"Our Black Friday Sale Starts NOW! Get 20% Off Everything!\" OR you create curiosity with something like \u201cWe\u2019re giving away gifts to people in {{Customers\\_City}}\u201d (The \u201cgift\u201d can simply be a free add-on with purchases over X amount. Bonus points for personalizing the subject line, it\u2019ll boost the open rate)\n3. **Design Clean, Eye-Catching Emails -** Use templates if you don\u2019t have a designer (hello, Canva). Make sure your emails are branded, easy to read, and mobile-friendly. Include urgency with countdown timers (Sendtric makes it easy to embed timers), and stick to one clear CTA (Call to Action). Whether the customer is looking for a Christmas gift or just a good deal, the email needs to flow in a way that ends with them checking out on your site.\n4. **Create Urgency** - Use language that creates FOMO. Set clear start and end dates for your sale, and send reminders as the end approaches. Time-sensitive offers work best\u2014let them know stock is limited, and they need to act fast. There's no better time to use scarcity and urgency than during BFCM. Go all out.\n5. **Optimize for Deliverability -** Don\u2019t blast out emails to your entire list at once, especially if you haven\u2019t been emailing regularly (You can send to your full list if you have less than 5k members on it). Segment and prioritize your engaged subscribers to improve your chances of landing in the inbox instead of the spam folder.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Here\u2019s a basic sending schedule for November:**\n\n**1. November 1 - Holiday Opt-Out Email**\n\n* A courtesy email offering customers the chance to opt out of holiday promotions to maintain high engagement. An unengaged subscriber hurts you more than they help you.\n\n**2. November 5 - Early Access VIP Announcement**\n\n* Notify VIP customers about their exclusive early access to upcoming Black Friday sales to create excitement and reward loyalty.\n\n**3. November 9 - Black Friday Sneak Peek**\n\n* Tease your audience with a preview of your best Black Friday deals, building anticipation with a countdown to the sale. This is your chance to show off new collections and this leads perfectly into the hype email.\n\n**4. November 15 - Hype Email**\n\n* Build excitement as Black Friday approaches, reminding everyone of the upcoming sale and highlighting a few top deals to create buzz.\n\n**5. November 20 - VIP Early Access Launch**\n\n* Grant early access to your Black Friday sale for VIP customers, emphasizing exclusivity and creating urgency with limited stock and timeframes.\n\n**6. November 24 - Black Friday Sale Launch**\n\n* Officially launch your Black Friday sale with a bold, straightforward email promoting the biggest discounts and encouraging immediate action.\n\n**7. November 27 - Black Friday Reminder Email**\n\n* Send a reminder that Black Friday deals are ending soon, using urgency and FOMO to prompt last-minute purchases.\n\n**8. November 30 - Cyber Monday Sale Launch**\n\n* Kick off your Cyber Monday sale with new deals, offering customers another chance to shop and promoting items left from Black Friday.\n\n**9.\u00a0December 5- Thank you email**\n\n* This is by far the most important email of the year. It's so important I made an entire post about it. This is your chance to send out a plain text email and simply express gratitude to your customers. I\u2019ve sent this email nearly 100 times, it almost always outperforms every email that was sent out during the ENTIRE YEAR. It is by far, the most lucrative email I\u2019ve ever sent out. Don\u2019t forget to say Thank you.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you for taking the time to read 1 of my many long-winded Reddit posts. I hope that you\u2019ve gained something from my post, and I wish you the best for BFCM season.",

Free Shipping over $69, 2. Safe and Secure Payments. 3. Satisfied Buyers - Check reviews what people say!)\n\n- payments: Paypal, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Google Pay, Apple Pay \n\n- 4 decent collections focusing on guitars, music production, and 2 music genres\n\n- Description section contains 3 collapsible secttions that can expand: 1. Details about the product (quality, etc), 2. Size Chart, 3. Shipping & Returns, MISSING regular product description\n\n- Sticky Add To Cart\n\n- Top Banner saying 2 tees for $50: Fall in Love with our Music Tees with \"Shop Now\" button that directly links to \"Best Sellers\" collection\n\nLastly, can you give a feedback to mockups?  Before I had those terrible flat lay mockups on the floor with some background elements. I heard it works for some niches, but I don't think it would work on music niche. Do I also need model mockups? And does that increase conversions? I got offer for $1500 to get 100 photos (50 front site and 50 backside) where each photo is slightly different from each other, creating nice natural feel where each product could be perceived unique. Is that smart move?\n\nHere is a photo of my current mockups: https://bit.ly/3Uf27BY\n\n  \nThis is my version 2 of my music store where I changed lot of things\n\n  \nThanks a lot\n\n",

    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nHere is a link to [my Etsy store](https://www.etsy.com/shop/papillonstudioprints/), Papillon Studio Prints.\n\nI'm wondering if I could gain some feedback from experienced sellers on Etsy. I wondered if you could be so kind as to critique my store/tags, particularly for my art prints? Here is an example of one:[ Sagittarius art print](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1426595623/sagittarius-mandala-art-print-bohemian).\n\nThese don't seem to sell at all, mostly because they aren't getting seen, so I'm open to any constructive feedback as to what I can work on for improvement. Are my tags ok? Does my photography suck?  How do you feel when you visit my store?  How could I make it feel more unique, like a gift store? (these are a constant whirlwind of questions running around in my head, haha.)\n\nI opened my Etsy shop in March 2023. I've made 14 sales, some from people I don't know, which I realise is great. I've learned from these sales that my audience are generally women (although some men have also ordered) and they seem to live in particularly nice areas, which makes me think they have a little extra cash to be able to spend on art, leading me to further think they appreciate interiors and enjoy art to make their space feel cosy. I also think they appreciate the eco side to things: I send all my cards naked (less waste) and have used a local printers who print all my prints onto FSC approved, 100% recycled paper. My aim as a seller is to help my audience make gifting easy, and all of my prints are taken from original hand drawings done by me, although I have tried not to use tags like original because I don't want to greenwash my customers into thinking they're buying original art when they're buying a print.\n\nI've done lots of research into keywords, and tried to pick out what I think my customers would search for, however I'm not gaining any footfall through Etsy traffic really. I get on average 1-2 views a day. People have historically found my cards, which is great, but the tags are somewhat similar so I kinda feel like I'm flying blind at the moment! I'm reading through the Etsy Seller Handbook again and trying to approach this in a \"starting over\" sense, but I'd really appreciate any constructive feedback!",

Even though the doll is coated I told them that she\u2019s delicate and for display only. I sent the package 1-2 days after. I am from Europe and the doll had to go to Brazil. The package arrived in Brazil in 2 weeks. Some time went by without any news. I contacted the buyer and after some searching I found out it was stuck in customs because there was information missing. They need the buyer\u2019s ID something I couldn\u2019t possibly be able to know. After that was settled the delivery company was really slow and the buyer got the doll 11 days after the estimated delivery time. Another 11 days passed and the buyer requested a refund because the doll arrived 30 days after, as they claimed, and mainly because the doll was not as shown and had damage. The doll was in perfect condition and well packed once I sent her and the damage that occurred was made by the buyer during those 11 days she was in their possession.

This would allow me to price all my options at once via a CSV file, rather that entering everything manually through the YMQ app. So, I'm really waiting for all that to happen before I push this too hard!\n\n1. Product w/ variants. The customer selects the options and quantity they want, then clicks an UPLOAD FILE button. This moves them to the UPLOAD page.\n\n2. Upload Page. On another page, the customer enters a PROJECT NAME and any SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS. They can also see some upload tips, and they can either UPLOAD their file(s) or hit UPLOAD LATER. If they upload, the file's progress bar moves to 100%, and when complete, the file is displayed. Then, they click CONTINUE TO CART.\n\n3. CART. The cart is super simple: PREVIEW of uploaded file (PDF or PNG preferred), PROJECT NAME and OPTIONS are listed, PRICE, and a small remove \"x\". Then on the right side of the page, the TOTAL price and a link to CHECKOUT.\n\nDo you know of any apps that can make this happen?",

    "content": "Hi,\n\nI know I post here a lot, but it's with good intention! I took the first 3 mths of my journey and gathered a LOT of feedback from this group! I'm starting a 2 week trial for ads, and this time I'm committing to it for the full 2 weeks. It will cost me $150, and I'm okay with that gamble. The ads look better, the set amount is $10/day for 15 days (so a bigger/longer timeframe to analyze) and one big thing I've focused on was finding higher-quality products! I think the site is a big improvement over it's initial first 60 days!\n\nSite: [https://theadventurersalley.com/](https://theadventurersalley.com/)\n\nI still would appreciate any more feedback! I'm still tinkering with it, but I've been feeling down because for the first 3 months I still haven't received a single sale (albeit, I did slow way down in September so I could gather my thoughts on it before proceeding, I had stopped all ads/content/etc at the time)\n\nThank you!",

    "content": "I run a website selling fitness programs as a pdf file. Once the customer buys it they get a download link in their email.\n\nThe program I use to automate it shows how many times they download / what they download.\n\nI have a $100 bundle that has 6 books in it. I\u2019ll get the occasional a-hole that will buy it, download everything, then immediately email looking for a refund.\n\nI can\u2019t not offer a refund policy as Google and Facebook sees that as a no no, but this problem isn\u2019t small enough to where the money won\u2019t be missed.\n\nAny ideas?",
